    </ul>
    <p>We store Personal Information for longer periods insofar as such Personal Information is required for any of the
      Purposes.</p>
    <p>We use reliable third parties&rsquo; services (<em>e.g.&nbsp;</em>Amazon, Microsoft, Google) for storing your
      personal data. We ensure these providers implement sufficient security measures, however, we do not always control
      the exact location of the servers on which your Personal Data is stored. Therefore, your Personal Data may be
      transferred to a third country or international organization to which an adequacy decision by the Commission (as
      defined in the GDPR) may or may not apply.</p>
    <p>However, after all, we may, knowingly or unknowingly, transfer your Personal Data to a country or international
      organization to which an adequacy decision by the Commission (as defined in the GDPR) does not apply and without
      implementing appropriate safeguards pursuant. Such transfer may put your Personal Data in risk. <strong>By

      unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate
      technical or organizational measures.</p>

      to make any of the aforementioned, pursuant to any applicable privacy laws.</p>
    <h2>HOW LONG WE KEEP INFORMATION</h2>
    <p>We keep your Information for only as long as we need to. How long we need your Information depends on what we are
      using it for, as set out in this Privacy Policy. For example, we may need to use it to answer your queries about a
      Product or Service and as a result may keep Information while you are still using our Product or Services. We may
      also need to keep your Information for accounting purposes. If we no longer need your Information, we will delete
      it or make it anonymous by removing all details that identify you. If we have asked for your permission to process
      your Information and we have no other lawful grounds to continue with that processing, and you withdraw your
      permission, we will delete your Information. You also have the right to ask Us to delete your Information or
      restrict how it is used. There may be exceptions to the right to erasure for specific legal reasons which, if
      applicable, We will set out for you in response to your request. Where applicable, you have the right to object to
      processing of your Information for certain purposes.</p>
