      non-sublicensable, revocable license for virtual items (such as a virtual game element or virtual coins), game

        Services&rdquo;</strong>), provided that you have registered an Account on the Service. You may only purchase
      Virtual Items from us or our authorized partners through the Service, and not in any other way. Recommended-Jobs.com may
      manage, regulate, control, modify, eliminate or change the price of virtual items and/or services at any time,
      with or without notice. Recommended-Jobs.com shall have no liability to you or any third party if Recommended-Jobs.com exercises any such
      rights. The transfer of virtual items is prohibited except where expressly authorized in the Service. Other than
      as expressly authorized in the Service, you shall not sell, redeem or otherwise transfer virtual items to any
      person or entity, including but not limited to Recommended-Jobs.com, another user or any third party.<br>Any purchases via the
      Service require you to enter into an agreement with either Recommended-Jobs.com or the relevant Payment Service Provider (&ldquo;PSP&rdquo;)
      to carry out the payment (you will see on the payment screen which PSP you are concluding the transaction with).
      As a parent/legal guardian you are responsible for any payments made via credit card or other payment instrument
      (e.g. phone, SMS, Paypal) on the Service by a minor.</p>
    <p>6.1.1. If the agreement is entered into with a PSP, Recommended-Jobs.com will never be held responsible for the communication
      between you and the PSP, and all information that you exchange with the PSP will be subject exclusively to the
      privacy policy and/or other terms and conditions of that PSP. Some PSP&rsquo;s allow preapproved recurrent
      payments and you agree to any terms and conditions that such PSP may set out for such recurring payments. For the
      avoidance of doubt, Recommended-Jobs.com is not, and will not become a party to your agreement with an PSP. By using a PSP for
      payments on the Service you indemnify Recommended-Jobs.com against reclaimed payments or other claims the PSP may have as a
      consequence of the non-performance of payment. In the event you pay via credit card, you may opt to enable the
      1-click payment option if offered by your credit card provider. By enabling this option and using it you agree to
      all terms and conditions set by the payment provider and your credit card provider for the use of this option.
      Recommended-Jobs.com accepts no liability for the use of this payment option.</p>
    <p>6.1.2. All information that we receive from you in the context of payments and supplying services on the Service
      are subject to the relevant Recommended-Jobs.com&rsquo; privacy policy. You agree to pay all applicable taxes and costs
      associated with your Account or anyone using an Account registered to you.</p>
    <p>6.2. If you purchase Paid Services via the Service, you will have no right to cancel your purchase and claim back
      any payments as your use commences upon supply, regardless of the moment your first spent your virtual items in a
      game.</p>
    <p>6.3. Recommended-Jobs.com and/or its licensors may manage, regulate, control, modify or eliminate Paid Services at any time,
      with or without notice. SPIL and/or its licensors shall not be liable to you or any third party in such event.</p>
    <p>6.4. Once a payment has been made for a Paid Service via the Service, there is no right to a refund. Recommended-Jobs.com
      reserves the right to cancel and delete all, or a part of (the balance of) the Paid Services you purchased on the
      Service if:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>you have not used your Account for 180 consecutive days, as referred to in 2.4 above;</li>
      <li>if we do no longer offer the content or Service that the (balance of) the Paid Services relates to, subject to
        prior notice by Recommended-Jobs.com to that extent;
      </li>
      <li>you fail to comply with these Terms of Use.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There is no right for refund or other compensation for unused Paid Services in this respect.</p>
    <p>If a Paid Service becomes unavailable following a transaction but prior to download, your sole remedy is limited
      to a refund of the price paid for the unavailable virtual product. If technical problems prevent or unreasonably
      delay delivery of your virtual product, your exclusive and sole remedy is either replacement or a refund of the
      price paid, as determined by Recommended-Jobs.com.</p>
    <p>We will accept your return of products that are not virtual products (e.g., virtual goods, subscriptions and game
      progress are virtual products) purchased through the Service as long as the products and packaging are returned in
      their original condition within thirty (30) days of shipment to you. When we ship you physical products, we will
      include a return authorization form that you need to enclose along with anything you send back to us. Virtual
